# fun-with-strings

This is a small python program I wrote to get a bit more familiar with tkinter for GUI design. It takes a string input (no error handling, yet) and provides things like:

* First character
* Last character
* Number of characters
* String in ALL CAPS

### Example output for a non-palindrome:

### How to run it on your own machine:

1) To start the app, simply download the 'string_info.py' file or fork and clone the repo to your local machine.

2) If you don't have Python3 installed on your machine, install it using your package manager of choice, or download and install from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3) Once Python is installed, the app can be run by opening up the terminal and navigating to the directory which holds the string_info.py file. Once we are there, we can start the app by typing 'python3 string_info.py' as seen below, and pressing Enter/Return:

```
python3 string_info.py
```
